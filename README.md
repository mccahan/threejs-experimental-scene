# Ryan's Big ThreeJS Scene

Viewable at [https://mccahan.github.io/threejs-experimental-scene/](https://mccahan.github.io/threejs-experimental-scene/), I wanted to experiment with modeling in Blender and exporting to ThreeJS, especially with animations. Everything in the scene was modeled by me (please ignore the geometry of the plane).
